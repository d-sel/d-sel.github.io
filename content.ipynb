    "The vast majority of the time, we are trying to make conclusions about something using imperfect data. These imperfections can be in the form of typos, values that require additional calculations and missing data points. Typos and inconsistencies can be dealt with as we can ‘find and replace’ to clean them up and perform simple calculations to convert them to something that is meaningful for our purposes. However, with missing data, we cannot replace something that is not there. Plus, if we have to work with the given data, we have to make use of what we have.\n",

We have a company employee survey and we want to determine which of the three departments has the most satisfied employees. The data shows the department the employee belongs to, how they were recruited, and their satisfaction response. Employees who were satisfied responded 'True' and those who weren't responded 'False'. Our data has 300 responses and 10 are shown here for context."

    "- If our missing data has a pattern within or outside of the dataset (scenario 3), we cannot ignore the rows. Instead, we should fill them with an appropriate value. This process is called imputation and there are many approaches that can be taken, some of which are simpler and others that require statistical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With numeric data, one of the simple approaches we can take is to populate the missing values of a column using the mean or mode (most frequent) of that column's existing data. An approach with text data is to group the rows and give all of the missing values within the same group the same value which helps to reflect some of the differences across groups which may provide more accuracy over using one value across the whole dataset.\n",

    "Missing data is something we all have to deal with; although it may not seem like an important aspect of our work, we must consider the importance of dealing with it properly or at least being aware of how our results may be affected. Once we classify our missing data, we can decide how to best deal with it. The simple approaches are usually sufficient, and if we decide that more complex methods are needed, we can explore more complex statistical approaches."
